#DIY Arduino (Atmega16A-Based)
A guide to building your own Arduino-compatible board from scratch using the Atmega16A microcontroller.

#Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a custom Arduino-style development board powered by the Atmega16A microcontroller. It walks through:

Hardware design: circuit and pin mapping

Firmware programming: both bare-metal in C and via Arduino IDE

Peripheral interfacing (e.g., LED, ADC, buttons)

It’s crafted to help you deeply understand how Arduino works at the MCU level.

Key Features
Bare-metal MCU setup using Atmega16A (no Arduino bootloader required)

External crystal oscillator for precise clocking

5 V power regulation for stable MCU operation

Arduino-style pin layout, including digital I/O, ADC, PWM, and power pins

Firmware programming options:

C via avr-gcc and AVRDUDE

Arduino IDE using MIGHTYCORE or similar cores
